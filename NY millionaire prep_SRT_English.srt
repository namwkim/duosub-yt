But I know someone who make around like 120. 

33
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,257
Dude, it's all over the place like depending on the job

34
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,301
As a product manager, I'd say the low end is

35
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,886
probably around hundred but guys at Google

36
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,429

37
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,222

someone that's new coming to New York

44
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,862
Come with friends. Be willing to live in like totally X situations 

45
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,614
and take whatever job that you can 

46
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,075
Take risks, try new things, push yourself

47
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,951
You know, think playing it safe in New York

48
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,994

00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,204
Are you in Tech or what do you do? 

50
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:19,996

80
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,093
pennies per stream on like Spotify or whatever
